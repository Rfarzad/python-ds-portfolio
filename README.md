# Python Data Science Project

This repository contains a collection of Python codes that showcase my growth in **data analysis, visualization, and programming**. Each section represents a structured exercise in data science fundamentals — ranging from simple functions and dictionaries to geospatial data exploration, time-based analytics, and real-world data cleaning.

## Repository Overview

| Notebook | Topic | Key Skills Demonstrated |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **HW1 – Functions, Lists, and Dictionaries** | Basic Python programming | Function creation, dictionary iteration, and summary statistics |
| **HW2 – Geocoding and Data Exploration** | Geographic data cleaning | `pandas`, missing value detection, `value_counts`, and data inspection |
| **HW3 – GroupBy, Pivot Table, Crosstab** | Temporal and user-based data analysis | Aggregation, pivoting, cross-tabulation, and user behavior insights |
| **HW4 – Data Cleaning and Visualization** | Human body measurement dataset | Outlier detection, `seaborn` visualizations, gender-based grouping |
| **HW5 – Pattern Matching and String Methods** | Airline flight data analysis | String operations, regular expressions (`.str.endswith`, `.str.match`), dataset merging |

## Key Learnings & Highlights

- **Structured Programming:**  
  Built reusable functions for summary statistics and dictionary processing.
  
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Identified and treated missing values, inconsistent entries, and outliers using `pandas`.

- **Exploratory Analysis:**  
  Created heatmaps, histograms, and pair plots to detect trends and anomalies.

- **Aggregation & Transformation:**  
  Used `groupby`, `pivot_table`, and `crosstab` to summarize multidimensional data.

- **String Manipulation:**  
  Applied pattern matching and regular expressions for text-based filtering and analysis.

- **Critical Thinking:**  
  Reflected on each assignment through self-evaluation, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement.

## 📈 Example Results

### 🐑 HW1 — Sheep Treatment Data
- Calculated mean worm counts for treated vs. untreated groups.
- Demonstrated the importance of functional programming in data summarization.

### 🌍 HW2 — City Dataset Exploration
- Loaded a 51,000+ city dataset.
- Found **2,457 repeated city names**, e.g., *Richmond*, *Santa Cruz*, *Springfield*.
- Practiced identifying missingness and analyzing frequency distributions.

### 🎬 HW3 — Movie Reviews Dataset
- Computed average lag between movie release and review date (~13.7 years).  
- Identified genre and user patterns in review timing using `pivot_table` and `groupby`.

### 👟 HW4 — Body Measurement Dataset
- Cleaned inconsistent height/skull values and dropped "Prefer not to say" entries.  
- Visualized distributions of height and shoe size by gender and athletic status using `seaborn`.

### ✈️ HW5 — Airline Flight Dataset
- Filtered 336,000 flight records.  
- Identified **19,144** flights from companies ending with “Inc.” or “Co.”  
- Found **12%** of Delta planes retained *Northwest Airlines* tail numbers (`NW`) after merger.
